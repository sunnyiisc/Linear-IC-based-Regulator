### Working on the Design

#### Component Values from matlab/octave:
Values of the components is calculated according to the specification from the simulation of the program (<>.m file) [click here](Linear_IC_Based_Regulator.m)

#### Simulation of the Circuit:
The Circuit can be simulated with spice, here I used gEDA for building the cirucuit netlist and then simulated it with the stimulus designed by me. I used the model of the diode too that is included in the netlist file.

#### Line Regulation
Line regulation is performed by varying input voltage keeping the load resistance constant(100Î©). Input voltage is varied using an auto transformer. Input voltage is measured at the secondary side to maintain safety. The output voltage remains almost same around 10V. But when the input voltage variation is very high, then the regulator is no longer able to maintain the output voltage.
